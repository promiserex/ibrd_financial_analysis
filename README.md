# 📊 IBRD Statement of Loans & Guarantees — Financial Analysis Dashboard

---

##  Project Background

The **International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)** provides financing to countries to support economic development, reduce poverty, and strengthen national infrastructure.

This project analyzes IBRD loan and guarantee records, covering key areas such as:

* Loan amounts
* Disbursements
* Repayments
* Loan status
* Borrower countries
* Current financial exposure

The goal is to clearly understand how countries **borrow, repay, and manage their financial obligations** with the IBRD. The project also includes an executive dashboard that presents the overall financial standing and supports informed decision-making.

---

##  Project Objectives

* Analyze outstanding loan exposure by country
* Evaluate repayment performance across borrowers
* Compare disbursed vs undisbursed loan amounts
* Track long-term repayment obligations through maturity timelines
* Assess project activity by country
* Deliver clear insights that support monitoring and strategic planning

---

## Executive Summary

Total repayments to IBRD stand at **USD 38 billion**, with **USD 45.1 billion** still outstanding across **1,264 active projects**. The analysis shows that repayment obligations are heavily concentrated between **2035 and 2050**, marking the most critical period for long-term cash-flow planning and risk monitoring. The findings reveal strong concentration in both country exposure and future repayment pressure.

##  Key Analytical Areas & Insights

---

## 1. Loans Held by Country

Outstanding loan exposure is heavily concentrated in just two countries. **Colombia ($17.9B)** and **Egypt ($14.3B)** sit far above all others, meaning most financial risk is tied to these two borrowers. After Egypt, exposure drops sharply, with **Ecuador at $7B**, already less than half of Colombia’s level. This shows a steep concentration at the top, where economic stress in the leading countries would have a much larger impact than changes across the rest.

---

## 2. Top Countries by Total IBRD & Third-Party Repayments

Repayment activity is dominated by a few countries. **Colombia leads with $15B** in direct IBRD repayments and an additional **$51M through third parties**, indicating both high borrowing and strong repayment discipline. **Egypt follows with $7B**, largely funded by government repayments. **Algeria holds $4B**, while **Costa Rica stands near $1B**.
A key shift appears with **France**, where direct IBRD repayments are very low (**$38K**) but third-party repayments reach **$250M**, showing strong reliance on external settlement.

---

## 3. Disbursed vs Undisbursed Amounts

**Colombia and Egypt alone account for over $50B in disbursed funding**, making them the primary drivers of overall exposure. Colombia shows strong fund absorption with a very small undisbursed balance. Egypt holds the largest undisbursed amount at **$1.9B**, while **China follows at $1.7B**, pointing to a growing pipeline.
A mid-tier group (**Ecuador, Algeria, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic**) adds steady but less concentrated exposure. Countries like **Gabon, Honduras, and Fiji** contribute minimal amounts and mainly support diversification.

---

## 4. IBRD Loan Maturity Timeline

Repayment obligations rise slowly until around 2030, reaching **$1.6B in 2031**, before accelerating sharply through the late 2030s. The main peak occurs in **2041 at $4.3B**, marking the period of highest repayment pressure. After briefly declining to **$189M**, repayments rise again into the early 2050s, reaching **$3.2B**. By **2059**, repayments stand at **$2.4B**.
Overall, repayment pressure is heavily concentrated between **2035 and 2055**, forming two major long-term financial stress points.

---

## 5. Number of Loan Projects by Country

Project activity is highly concentrated. **Colombia leads with 281 projects**, making it the most operationally active country. A second tier — **Ecuador, Algeria, and Egypt** — follows with more than **120 projects each**.
Mid-range activity appears in the **Dominican Republic and Guatemala (82 projects each)**. The remaining countries (**Costa Rica, Honduras, Georgia, and Gabon**) hold much smaller volumes and contribute limited operational weight.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Focus increased monitoring on Colombia and Egypt**
   These two countries drive most lending, repayments, and project activity.

2. **Spread future lending across more countries**
   Expanding support to mid-tier borrowers will reduce concentration risk.

3. **Strengthen oversight of undisbursed funds in Egypt and China**
   Better tracking will improve project execution and reduce delays.

4. **Prepare early for major repayment peaks (2035–2055)**
   Advance planning will help manage financial pressure during high-repayment years.

5. **Adjust operational resources based on project activity**
   Countries with the highest number of projects should receive greater technical and supervisory support.

## Key Financial Note

The **disbursed amount** represents the total money the IBRD has ever released to borrowers. Over time, many countries have repaid part of what they borrowed. These repayments reduce the **Loans Held (outstanding balance)**, but the original disbursed total remains unchanged. This is why **disbursed values are higher than current outstanding loan balances**.
